***42 LIBFT***

## SUMMARY

LIBFT's main goal is to create a C library coding all C most essential functions, but from scratch. The key aspect of this project is the design of C most common and useful function without the aid of external libraries that would be normally used. Recreating these functions is a valuable exercise for understanding their inner workings, limitations, and potential unexpected results. Unit testing is also an essential part of the project.
I delved into this project because I knew that by studying the inner functioning of C I would have understood a lot more than simply including a header. A lot more work of course than "#include <stdio.h>", but I can say it paid off.

The C library functions are nothing to be messed with. They are system library functions for a reason and considering that they are around since the inception of C in ***1978*** they are virtually bulletproof so writing them manually is an adventure that I embarked to appreciate them in their full beauty and technical mastery.
Due to its nature as a low-level language, C enables operations that function at an extremely granular level, delving deep into the intricacies of computer hardware. Languages like Python or JavaScript instead work at a so much higher level that everything happens under the hood without you knowing, which is handy, but not as fun.

For this project, only three standard library functions are permitted: write() from <unistd.h>, malloc(), and free() from <stdlib.h>. Additionally, I used <string.h> for size_t and NULL.

## The functions in LIBFT are categorized into three types:

- Lib C Functions: These functions originate from standard C libraries, but they are prefixed with "ft_" to avoid conflicts with the original ones.

- 42 Functions: These functions are specific to Ecole 42 and primarily deal with memory and string manipulation.

- List Functions: These functions are used for creating and manipulating lists.
